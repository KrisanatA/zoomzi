# zoomzi

Remember Prezi for presentations where you can zoom in to parts of your presentation

Here what we offer is a way for you to setup a ggplot and then setup the slides so that you can zoom in to them as needed. 

This is fully inspired by Emil's package. All credit goes to their package editable

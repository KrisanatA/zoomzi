# zoomzi

Remember Prezi for presentations where you can zoom in to parts of your presentation?

Here what we offer is a way for you to setup a ggplot and then setup the slides so that you can zoom in to them as needed. 

This is fully inspired by Emil's revealjs-plugin [editable](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-revealjs-editable). All credit in the structure of this package goes to their package.
